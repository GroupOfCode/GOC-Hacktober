## Segment Tree:

A segment Tree is a Data structure that can be used to perform range Min/Max/Sum queries and Range Updates in O(log(n)) worst time complexity

<details>
<summary>1. Rules</summary>
    1. Segment Trees must be a height-balanced Binary Tree .i.e.<br>
    2. Built on top of an array.<br>
    3. The parent node must contain the computed result of its children

<summary>2. Uses</summary>
    1. Used to search data in Big Datasets<br>
    2. Perform heavy range Operations

<summary>3. Time Complexities</summary>
    1. Creation: O(N) <br>
    2. Range_sum: O(log(N))<br>
    3. Update: O(log(N))<br>
